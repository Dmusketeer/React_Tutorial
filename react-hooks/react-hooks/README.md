# React Hooks
<!-- source: w3schools -->
## What is a Hook?
- Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.

- Hooks allow us to "hook" into React features such as state and lifecycle methods. 


### State: 
- State generally refers to application data or properties that need to be tracked.

### Custom Hooks
- If you have stateful logic that needs to be reused in several components, you can build your own custom Hooks.


## React useState Hook:
- The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component.
