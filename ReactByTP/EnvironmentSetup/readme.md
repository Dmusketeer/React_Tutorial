# --------------------------- Environment Setup ---------------------------

## Software
- To run React Application we need <b>Nodejs An d NPM </b>.
- After successfully installing NodeJS, we can start installing React upon it using npm. You can install ReactJS in two ways

       1. Using webpack and babel.
       2. Using the create-react-app command.


## Installing ReactJS using webpack and babel 

- Webpack is a module bundler (manages and loads independent modules). It takes dependent modules and compiles them to a single (file) bundle. You can use this bundle while developing apps using command line or, by configuring it using webpack.config file.

- Babel is a JavaScript compiler and transpiler. It is used to convert one source code to other. Using this you will be able to use the new ES6 features in your code where, babel converts it into plain old ES5 which can be run on all browsers.
