## What is JSX?
- JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
- JSX is an XML/HTML like extension to JavaScript.
- Just like HTML, JSX tags can have a tag names, attributes, and children.
-  If an attribute is wrapped in curly braces, the value is a JavaScript expression.

<b>Note</b> that JSX does not use quotes around the HTML text string.

## What is Babel?
- Babel is a JavaScript compiler that can translate markup or programming languages into JavaScript.
- React uses Babel to convert JSX into JavaScript.
## what is diffrence between library and framework?
- The main key difference between the Library and Framework is something known as <b>inversion of control</b>.
- When you import a library, you have to call the specific methods or functions of your choice so, and it's up to you when and where to call the Library
- Here, you are in charge of flow.
- On the other hand, Framework itself makes a call to your code and provide you with some space to write down details.
- So, while using framework your framework is in charge of flow.
