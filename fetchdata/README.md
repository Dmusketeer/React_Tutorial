# Introduction
- React is one of the JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces or UI components. Many react projects require interaction with the outside world data. For example, when we want to create a weather application, we need accurate data which should change dynamically. We can access this data by fetching API.

## Different ways to Fetch data in React js.
1) Fetch Method
2) Async-Await
3) Axios library
4) Custom Hook
5) Usage in the component
6) React Query library
